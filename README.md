## Variable Notes

`pclass`: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)

- 1st = Upper
- 2nd = Middle
- 3rd = Lower

`age`: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

`sibsp`: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

- Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
- Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

`parch`: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

- Parent = mother, father
- Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
- Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
